  Abstract                 = {Source code is the target and final outcome of software development. By focusing our research and analysis on source code only, we risk forgetting that software is the product of human efforts, where communication plays a pivotal role. One of the most used communications means are emails, which have become vital for any distributed development project. Analyzing email archives is non-trivial, due to the noisy and unstructured nature of emails, the vast amounts of information, the unstandardized storage systems, and the gap with development tools. We present Miler, a toolset that allows the exploration of this form of communication, in the context of software maintenance and evolution. With Miler we can retrieve data from mailing list repositories in different formats, model emails as first-class entities, and transparently store them in databases. Miler offers tools and support for navigating the content, manually labelling emails with discussed source code entities, automatically linking emails to source code, measuring code entities' popularity in mailing lists, exposing structured content in the unstructured content, and integrating email communication in an IDE.},

This survey-based study, conducted with 402 active LUG members representing 191 different LUGs from 23 countries and employing structural equation modeling methodology, supports the proposed model. Furthermore, we find that the Linux user's experience level moderates the extent of the LUG's social influence and its impact on the user's participation. We conclude with a consideration of the managerial and research implications of the study's findings.},

  Abstract                 = {In the last decade, developers have been increasingly sharing their questions with each other through Question and Answer (Q&A) websites. As a result, these websites have become valuable knowledge repositories, covering a wealth of topics related to particular programming languages. This knowledge is even more useful as the developer community evaluates both questions and answers through a voting mechanism. As votes accumulate, the developer community recognizes reputed members and further trusts their answers. In this paper, we analyze the community's questions and answers to determine the developers' personality traits, using the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC). We explore the personality traits of Stack Overflow authors by categorizing them into different categories based on their reputation. Through textual analysis of Stack Overflow posts, we found that the top reputed authors are more extroverted compared to medium and low reputed users. Moreover, authors of up-voted posts express significantly less negative emotions than authors of down-voted posts.},

These signals, when aggregated and summarized, could be used to define potential candidates' individual profiles: potential employers could qualitatively evaluate job seekers, even those lacking a formal degree or changing their career path, by assessing candidates' online contributions. At the same time, developers are aware of the Web's public nature and the possible uses of published information when they determine what to share with the world. Some might even try to manipulate public signals of technical qualifications, soft skills, and reputation in their favor. Assessing candidates on the Web for technical positions presents challenges to recruiters, the most serious being the interpretation of the provided signals. An in-depth discussion proposes guidelines for software engineers and recruiters to help recruiters interpret the value and trouble with the signals and metrics they use to assess a candidate's characteristics and skills.},

However, the complexities of using content analysis in a relatively new research field have resulted in researchers often avoiding this method and using more familiar methods such as survey and interview instead. This article discusses content analysis as a methodology, with emphasis on the development of analytical frameworks. The literature indicates that researchers either use or modify existing frameworks or, more commonly, develop new ones, either through grounded theory approaches or the adaptation of existing theories, concepts or models. The development and implementation of two frameworks are then discussed in detail. Both were developed purposively to investigate and evaluate firstly collaborative learning and secondly deep and surface approaches to learning as evidenced in computer Conf.s. The article concludes with recommendations for framework development. },

An ecosystem consists of a core platform and a halo of user contributions that provide value to a company or project. In order to sustain the level and number of high-quality contributions, it is crucial for companies and contributors to understand how ecosystems tend to evolve and can be maintained successfully over time. As a first step, this paper explores the evolution characteristics of the statistical computing project GNU R, which is a successful, end-user programming ecosystem. We find that the ecosystem of user-contributed R packages has been growing steadily since R's conception, at a significantly faster rate than core packages, yet each individual package remains stable in size. We also identified differences in the way user-contributed and core packages are able to attract an active community of users.},

Of particular interest is the study of the activities and interactions between the persons involved in the software development process. The main challenge with such studies lies in the ability to determine the identities (e.g., logins or e-mail accounts) in software repositories that represent the same physical person. To achieve this, different identity merge algorithms have been proposed in the past. This article provides an objective comparison of identity merge algorithms, including some improvements over existing algorithms. The results are validated on a selection of large ongoing open source software projects. },

We find that link sharing is a significant phenomenon on Stack Overflow, that Stack Overflow is an important resource for software development innovation dissemination and that its part of a larger interconnected network of online resources used and referenced by developers. This knowledge can guide researchers and practitioners who build tools and services that support software developers in the exploration, discovery, and adoption of software development innovations.},

  Abstract                 = {Information and communication technology (ICT) can enhance knowledge sharing by lowering temporal and spatial barriers between knowledge workers, and improving access to information about knowledge. Looking at ICT for knowledge sharing in this light, however, has limited value, because it ignores when and how the quality of knowledge sharing will be enhanced. A more encompassing perspective will come about if ICT is studied with relation to the motivation for knowledge sharing. The article explores this perspective by developing a theoretical model identifying and linking the variables involved. By presenting the outcomes of an empirical investigation, it also illustrates the differential effects of ICT on the motivation for knowledge sharing in different settings.

  Abstract                 = {Popular social coding sites like GitHub and BitBucket are changing software development. Users follow some interesting developers, listen to their activities and find new projects. Social relationships between users are utilized to disseminate projects, attract contributors and increase the popularity. A deep understanding of project dissemination on social coding sites can provide important insights into questions of project diffusion characteristics and into the improvement of the popularity. In this paper, we seek a deeper understanding of project dissemination in GitHub. We collect 2,665 projects and 272,874 events. Moreover, we crawl 747,107 developers and 2,234,845 social links to construct social graphs. We analyze topological characteristics and reciprocity of social graphs. We then study the speed and the range of project dissemination, and the role of social links. Our main observations are: (1) Social relationships are not reciprocal. (2) The popularity increases gradually for a long time. (3) Projects spread to users far away from their creators. (4) Social links play a notable role of project dissemination. These results can be leveraged to increase the popularity. Specifically, we suggest that project owners should (1) encourage experienced developers to choose some promising new developers, follow them in return and provide guidance. (2) promote projects for a long time. (3) advertise projects to a wide range of developers. (4) fully utilize social relationships to advertise projects and attract contributors.},

  Abstract                 = {Nowadays, many software companies are shifting from the traditional 18-month release cycle to shorter release cycles. For example, Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox release new versions every 6 weeks. These shorter release cycles reduce the users' waiting time for a new release and offer better marketing opportunities to companies, but it is unclear if the quality of the software product improves as well, since shorter release cycles result in shorter testing periods. In this paper, we empirically study the development process of Mozilla Firefox in 2010 and 2011, a period during which the project transitioned to a shorter release cycle. We compare crash rates, median uptime, and the proportion of post-release bugs of the versions that had a shorter release cycle with those having a traditional release cycle, to assess the relation between release cycle length and the software quality observed by the end user. We found that (1) with shorter release cycles, users do not experience significantly more post-release bugs and (2) bugs are fixed faster, yet (3) users experience these bugs earlier during software execution (the program crashes earlier).},

  Abstract                 = {Understanding an individual's contribution to an ecosystem often necessitates integrating information from multiple repositories corresponding to different projects within the ecosystem or different kinds of repositories (e.g., mail archives and version control systems). However, recognising that different contributions belong to the same contributor is challenging, since developers may use different aliases. It is known that existing identity merging algorithms are sensitive to large discrepancies between the aliases used by the same individual: the noisier the data, the worse their performance. To assess the scale of the problem for a large software ecosystem, we study all Gnome Git repositories, classify the differences in aliases, and discuss robustness of existing algorithms with respect to these types of differences. We then propose a new identity merging algorithm based on Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), designed to be robust against more types of differences in aliases, and evaluate it empirically by means of cross-validation on Gnome Git authors. Our results show a clear improvement over existing algorithms in terms of precision and recall on worst-case input data.},

  Abstract                 = {Free/Open Source Software (F/OSS) projects are people-oriented and knowledge intensive software development environments. Many researchers focused on mailing lists to study coding activities of software developers. How expert software developers interact with each other and with non-developers in the use of community products have received little attention. This paper discusses the altruistic sharing of knowledge between knowledge providers and knowledge seekers in the Developer and User mailing lists of the Debian project. We analyze the posting and replying activities of the participants by counting the number of email messages they posted to the lists and the number of replies they made to questions others posted. We found out that participants interact and share their knowledge a lot, their positing activity is fairly highly correlated with their replying activity, the characteristics of posting and replying activities are different for different kinds of lists, and the knowledge sharing activity of self-organizing Free/Open Source communities could best be explained in terms of what we called "Fractal Cubic Distribution" rather than the power-law distribution mostly reported in the literature. The paper also proposes what could be researched in knowledge sharing activities in F/OSS projects mailing list and for what purpose. The research findings add to our understanding of knowledge sharing activities in F/OSS projects. },

  Abstract                 = {Stack Overflow is an enormously popular question-and-answer web site intended for software developers to help each other with programming issues. Some software projects aimed at developers (for example, application programming interfaces, application engines, cloud services, development frameworks, and the like) are closing their self-supported developer discussion forums and mailing lists and instead directing developers to use special-purpose tags on Stack Overflow. The goals of this paper are to document the main reasons given for moving developer support to Stack Overflow, and then to collect and analyze data from a group of software projects that have done this, in order to show whether the expected quality of support was actually achieved. The analysis shows that for all four software projects in this study, two of the desired quality indicators, developer participation and response time, did show improvements on Stack Overflow as compared to mailing lists and forums. However, we also found several projects that moved back from Stack Overflow, despite achieving these desired improvements. The results of this study are applicable to a wide variety of software projects that provide developer support using social media.},

Using publicly-available archives of 8800 mailing lists, we examine the adoption of the pastebin tool by software developers and compare it to the model presented in Diffusion of Innovation (DoI) theory. We then compare the rate at which software developers decided whether to accept or reject the new pastebin tools. We find that the overall rate of pastebin adoption follows the S-curve predicted by classic DoI theory. We then compare the individual pastebin services and their rates of adoption, as well as the reaction of different communities to the new tools and the various rationales for accepting or rejecting them.},

The term "user assistance" encompasses all the ways that users get help in figuring out how to use a product, spanning the traditional categories of both documentation and support. User assistance provides opportunities for participation by community members who are not software developers. This in turn relieves the burden on developers for filling these roles while broadening the community. Projects should support the differing motivations of members in these roles while providing leadership and direction, removing barriers to contribution, and engaging in concerted efforts. Licensing for open source documentation should likewise be open, to support user freedom and foster community collaboration. Leaders in open source user assistance need to share ideas across projects in order to improve their offerings.},

  Abstract                 = {Although a plethora of tools are available for Global Software Engineering (GSE) teams, it is being realized increasingly that the most prevalent desktop metaphor underpinning the majority of tools have several inherent limitations. We have proposed that Activity-Based Computing (ABC) can be a promising alternative to build tools for GSE. However, significant effort is required to introduce a new paradigm; there is a need of sound theoretical foundation based on activity theory to address challenges faced by tools in GSE. This paper reports our effort aimed at building theoretical foundations for applying activity theory to GSE. We analyze and explain the fundamental concepts of activity theory, and how they can be applied by using examples of software architecture design and evaluation processes. We describe the kind of data model and architectural support required for applying activity theory in building supporting infrastructure for GSE, and describe a proof of concept prototype.},

It is explained that the purpose of this reply is to reaffirm the role of the case study as a systematic research tool. The research found that people are likely to react adversely whenever they are confronted with individualized data, but are likely to be more tolerant when confronted with aggregate data.},

  Abstract                 = {In recent years, searching for source code on the web has become increasingly common among professional software developers and is emerging as an area of academic research. This volume surveys past research and presents the state of the art in the area of "code retrieval on the web." This work is concerned with the algorithms, systems, and tools to allow programmers to search for source code on the web and the empirical studies of these inventions and practices. It is a label that we apply to a set of related research from software engineering, information retrieval, human-computer interaction, management, as well as commercial products. The division of code retrieval on the web into snippet remixing and component reuse is driven both by empirical data, and analysis of existing search engines and tools. Contributors include leading researchers from human-computer interaction, software engineering, programming languages, and management. "Finding Source Code on the Web for Remix and Reuse" consists of five parts. Part I is titled "Programmers and Practices," and consists of a retrospective chapter and two empirical studies on how programmers search the web for source code. Part II is titled "From Data Structures to Infrastructures," and covers the creation of ground-breaking search engines for code retrieval required ingenuity in the adaptation of existing technology and in the creation of new algorithms and data structures. Part III focuses on "Reuse: Components and Projects," which are reused with minimal modification. Part IV is on "Remix: Snippets and Answers," which examines how source code from the web can also be used as solutions to problems and answers to questions. The book concludes with Part V, "Looking Ahead," that looks at future programming and the legalities of software reuse and remix and the implications of current intellectual property law on the future of software development. The story, "Richie Boss: Private Investigator Manager," was selected as the winner of a crowdfunded short story contest."},
