# MSR 2016 special issue published by the Springer journal Empirical Software Engineering (EMSE)

Submission instructions:

>For creating your extended version please make sure you pay attention to the following: 
>
>* Your manuscript needs to add additional content over the conference paper version. While the exact type and quantity of this content varies from paper to paper, a rule of thumb is that the paper should have at least 30% new content (to be safe, consider that to be 30% new work, and not just a writeup that is 30% longer). 
>
>* The journal's author instructions can be found via http://www.springer.com/computer/swe/journal/10664 
>
>* Please re-read and substantively address the reviewer's comments. There will likely be partial overlap between MSR and journal reviewing, and nothing is more annoying to a reviewer than reading a revised version of a paper with the same problems as the previous version. Make sure to include a cover letter that details how you have extended your conference paper and how you addressed reviewer comments with your submission. 
>
>* Please ensure to submit an overall high quality manuscript; EMSE is a high-quality, high-impact journal.
