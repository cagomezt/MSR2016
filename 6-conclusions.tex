\section{Conclusions}
\label{cha:conclusion}

    Understanding the interplay between channels should be the next step to gain further insights into software development practices.
    To that end, we contrasted the way knowledge is shared on Stack Overflow and the R-help mailing list, as well as an extensible categorization of Q\&A channel messages that is meant to be used to compare and analyse knowledge in media channels.
    To conduct a fair comparison, we collected raw data from both channels, transformed this data to a common format through an analysis of the messages to map questions, answers, and other elements.

    After the analysis of more than 500 threads, we identified five types of messages: question, answer, comment, update, and flag; and more than 35 categories along with their properties, including how-to question, tutorial answer, announcement update, not-an-answer flag, and clarifications comment.

    We identified two mechanisms for the construction of knowledge: \emph{participatory}, in which answers are created with the collaboration of various users; and \emph{crowd-based}, which is non-collaborative and where solutions are posted without any acknowledgement to previous answers.
    We also analysed links and how these contribute to the construction of knowledge, such as by referencing source code, projects, and other posts related to a particular question.

    We also identified user behaviours based on their comments.
    We noted certain usage characteristics such as solving their own question by providing the answer, and cross-posting in both channels.

    To bring further insights on our findings, we conducted a survey that collected 26 answers from R users.
    The result was a list of pros and cons of using both channels. We incorporated them in the set of recommendations for using multiple channels and resources.
