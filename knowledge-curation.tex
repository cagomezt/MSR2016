\begin{abstract}
  One of the many effects of social media in software development is the flourishing of very large communities of practice. Broadly defined, a community of
  practice in software engineering is a group of people who share a common interest on a technology (such as a programming language, framework, tool,
  etc). Communities of practice have become an important contributor to the diffusion of their corresponding technology by creating and sharing knowledge about
  it.  Communities of practice use many different communication channels, and little is know about how these communities create, share and curate knowledge
  using such channels.  In this paper we report a qualitative study of how one community of practice (the R software development community) creates and curates
  knowledge regarding questions-and-answers (Q\&A) in two of its main communication channels: the r-tag in Stack Overflow and the R-users mailing list. The
  results reveal that knowledge is created and curated in two main forms: participatory (where multiple members explicitly collaborate) and crowed-sourced
  (where individuals work relatively independently of each other). The contributions of this paper is a characterization of the types of knowledge that are
  exchanged by these communities of practice, including a description of the reasons why members choose one channel over the other.  Finally, this paper
  enumerates a set of recommendations to assist practitioners in the use of multiple channels for Q\&A.
